# START Hack 2022 - SBB Case

### Case Introduction
Travelers more and more want to take their bicycle on the train to discover
Switzerland. For self-service loading of bicycles SBB offers space on the train, which
customer need to reserve upfront. On top of that at the weekend there is extra space
available staffs helping travelers to load their bicycles in a separate wagon. But also
with that extra capacity space can going to be scarce at days weather is supposed to
become nice. However, if the weather is rainy or cold spaces are not used and there are not so many staffs
needed.

Please give a short introduction to your case.
What is the problem you are solving?
A prediction for the upcoming weekend at which time bicycle slots on the train are
already fully booked. So customers can get the information of the latest timeslot they
probably should book their reservation to get a free bicycle space depending on the
train or trainline. Furthermore, internal staffing can be adjusted upfront depending on
the predicted demand for bicycle transportation.
